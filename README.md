# PopGen3

## Introduction

**PopGen** is a state-of-the-art open-source synthetic population generator for advanced travel demand modeling. Developed under the guidance of Professor Ram M. Pendyala at Arizona State University, PopGen utilizes a heuristic algorithm (IPU) to control and match both household-level and person-level attribute distributions.

## Key Features

- Advanced control of household and person variables across multiple geographic resolutions (region and geo).
- Command-line interface for simplified usage and enhanced computational efficiency.
- Fully compatible with Python 3, with updated dependencies.
  
## Previous Version

### Data Inputs

#### Survey sample data:
  `household_sample.csv`: household-level data  
  `person_sample.csv`: individual-level data

#### Population marginal data:

- **geo-level marginals:**  
     `person_marginals.csv`  
     `household_marginals.csv`  

- **region-level marginals:**  
  `region_person_marginals.csv`  
  `region_household_marginals.csv`  

#### Multi-Geographic Resolution Mapping Data:

  `region_geo_mapping.csv`  
  `geo_sample_mapping.csv`

Mapping files ensure accurate mapping and alignment of different data files with different resolutions. 

Example of survey and marginal data collected and labeled with different geographic resolution levels:

- **Region level**: Set as census county subdivision
- **Geo level**: Set as census tracts
- **Sample Geo level**: Set as Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs)
